### AI Study Coach with Memori & LangGraph

An AI-powered **Study Coach** that uses **Memori v3** as long-term memory and **LangGraph** for multi-step verification of understanding.

- **Plans & tracks** your learning via a Streamlit UI.
- Uses **LangGraph** to generate quizzes and evaluate real understanding.
- Stores **structured learner profiles and study sessions in Memori** (SQLite/Postgres/MySQL/MongoDB, configurable).
- Provides a **Memori-powered chat** to reflect on progress, weak topics, and learning patterns.

### Features

- 🧭 **Study Plan tab**
  - Capture a structured learner profile:
    - Name / handle
    - Main goal (e.g. “Pass AWS SAA”, “Master LangGraph”)
    - Timeframe
    - Subjects / topics
    - Weekly study hours
    - Preferred formats (videos, docs, practice problems, etc.)
  - Profile is saved into **Memori** as a tagged JSON document and automatically reused across sessions.

- 📅 **Today’s Session tab**
  - Log each study session:
    - Topic, duration, resource type, perceived difficulty, mood, notes.
  - Runs a **LangGraph-powered verification flow**:
    - Generates 3–5 quiz questions.
    - Prompts you to explain the topic “in your own words”.
    - Evaluates understanding (0–100), surfaces feedback, and suggests a next step.
  - Writes a summarised study session into **Memori** (topic, score, difficulty, mood, feedback, next step).

- 📈 **Progress & Memory tab (chat)**
  - Chat with a Memori-backed assistant about your learning history:
    - “What are my weakest topics right now?”
    - “When do I usually perform best?”
    - “Do I learn better from videos or practice problems?”
  - Uses the same Memori store that holds your profile + session summaries.

- ⚙️ **CockroachDB storage**
  - Uses **CockroachDB** via a Postgres+psycopg SQLAlchemy URL stored in `MEMORI_DB_URL`, e.g.  
    `postgresql+psycopg://user:password@host:26257/database`
